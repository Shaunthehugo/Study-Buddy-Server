# Study-Buddy-Server
This server is going to be used to hold the data and push notifications for Study Buddy users. The reason for using [Parse Server](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server) is because of the looming shutdown for the service and my trial with Firebase was cut short after learning it wasn't as customizable.

There is a stable release for Study Buddy [here](https://github.com/Shaunthehugo/Study-Buddy/releases/tag/v1.0) and is available on the App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/study-buddy-messaging-app/id1112312221?ls=1&mt=8)
